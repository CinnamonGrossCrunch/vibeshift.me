## Project Philosophy

Core Principles:
- Single Source of Truth: All data flows through /api/unified-dashboard
- User-First Design: Default visibility ON for important content
- Mobile-First: Optimize for mobile first
- Performance: Cache aggressively (24hr for AI, 30min for scraping)
- Consistency: Newsletter Widget and Calendar must show identical content
