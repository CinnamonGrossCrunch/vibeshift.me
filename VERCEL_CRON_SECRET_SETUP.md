# üîê CRON_SECRET Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Instructions

### 1. Open Vercel Dashboard
Go to: https://vercel.com/matt-gross-projects-2589e68e/vibeshift.me/settings/environment-variables

### 2. Add Environment Variable

**Name:** `CRON_SECRET`

**Value:**
```
b5f6eb7aef6326b4881fdc9e48f9ec367bf45b41354bdc44e83caf8359ebfd52
```

**Environment:** 
- ‚úÖ Production

## What This Enables

Once added, your two cron jobs will activate:

### üåô Midnight Cache Refresh (7:00 AM UTC / 12:00 AM Pacific)
- **Path:** `/api/cron/refresh-cache`
- **Purpose:** Pre-generates week analysis for date/week boundary changes
- **Duration:** ~5-10 seconds
- **Benefit:** Fresh data every morning

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Morning Newsletter Refresh (3:10 PM UTC / 8:10 AM Pacific)
- **Path:** `/api/cron/refresh-newsletter`
- **Purpose:** Scrapes and organizes latest newsletter content
- **Duration:** ~40-60 seconds
- **Benefit:** Newsletter updates before most users wake up

## How to Verify It's Working

### Option 1: Check Vercel Logs
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/matt-gross-projects-2589e68e/vibeshift.me/logs
2. Filter by "Cron"
3. Look for successful executions at scheduled times

### Option 2: Manual Test (After Adding Secret)
Run this in PowerShell to test the endpoint:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://vibeshift.me/api/cron/refresh-cache" `
  -Headers @{"Authorization"="Bearer b5f6eb7aef6326b4881fdc9e48f9ec367bf45b41354bdc44e83caf8359ebfd52"} `
  -Method GET -TimeoutSec 90
```

Expected response: `{"success": true, "message": "Cache refreshed successfully"}`

## Performance Impact

**Before (Current State):**
- First user per hour waits 8-20 seconds for newsletter scraping
- Cached users get 50-200ms loads

**After (With CRON_SECRET Active):**
- ‚úÖ **ALL users get 50-200ms loads** (40-100x improvement)
- ‚úÖ Newsletter always fresh (updated at 8:10 AM)
- ‚úÖ Week analysis always current (updated at midnight)
- ‚úÖ Zero user-facing delays

---

## Security Note

This secret is used to:
1. Authenticate cron job requests from Vercel's infrastructure
2. Prevent unauthorized cache refreshes
3. Ensure only Vercel can trigger expensive operations

**Keep it secret!** Don't commit to git (already in .gitignore as .env.local)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Cron Jobs Not Running?
- ‚úÖ Check secret is added in Vercel Dashboard
- ‚úÖ Verify secret is set to "Production" environment only
- ‚úÖ Wait for next scheduled execution time
- ‚úÖ Check Vercel logs for error messages

### Manual Test Failing?
- Ensure you're using the production URL (`vibeshift.me`)
- Check the Authorization header matches exactly
- Verify the cron route is deployed (should be in latest deployment)

---

## Next Steps After Adding Secret

1. ‚úÖ Add `CRON_SECRET` to Vercel (this guide)
2. ‚è≥ Wait for next scheduled cron execution
3. üìä Monitor Vercel logs for successful runs
4. üéâ Enjoy instant page loads for all users!
