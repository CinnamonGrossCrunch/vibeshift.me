### 1. Open Vercel Dashboard
Go to: https://vercel.com/matt-gross-projects-2589e68e/vibeshift.me/settings/environment-variables

### 2. Add Environment Variable

**Name:** `CRON_SECRET`

**Value:**
```
b5f6eb7aef6326b4881fdc9e48f9ec367bf45b41354bdc44e83caf8359ebfd52

## What This Enables

Once added, your two cron jobs will activate:

### 🌙 Midnight Cache Refresh (7:00 AM UTC / 12:00 AM Pacific)
- **Path:** `/api/cron/refresh-cache`
- **Purpose:** Pre-generates week analysis for date/week boundary changes
- **Duration:** ~5-10 seconds
- **Benefit:** Fresh data every morning

### ☀️ Morning Newsletter Refresh (3:10 PM UTC / 8:10 AM Pacific)
- **Path:** `/api/cron/refresh-newsletter`
- **Purpose:** Scrapes and organizes latest newsletter content
- **Duration:** ~40-60 seconds
- **Benefit:** Newsletter updates before most users wake up

## How to Verify It's Working

### Option 1: Check Vercel Logs
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/matt-gross-projects-2589e68e/vibeshift.me/logs
2. Filter by "Cron"
3. Look for successful executions at scheduled times

### Option 2: Manual Test (After Adding Secret)
Run this in PowerShell to test the endpoint:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://vibeshift.me/api/cron/refresh-cache" `
  -Headers @{"Authorization"="Bearer b5f6eb7aef6326b4881fdc9e48f9ec367bf45b41354bdc44e83caf8359ebfd52"} `
  -Method GET -TimeoutSec 90
```

Expected response: `{"success": true, "message": "Cache refreshed successfully"}`

## Performance Impact

**Before (Current State):**
- First user per hour waits 8-20 seconds for newsletter scraping
- Cached users get 50-200ms loads

**After (With CRON_SECRET Active):**
- ✅ **ALL users get 50-200ms loads** (40-100x improvement)
- ✅ Newsletter always fresh (updated at 8:10 AM)
- ✅ Week analysis always current (updated at midnight)
- ✅ Zero user-facing delays

---

## Security Note

This secret is used to:
1. Authenticate cron job requests from Vercel's infrastructure
2. Prevent unauthorized cache refreshes
3. Ensure only Vercel can trigger expensive operations

**Keep it secret!** Don't commit to git (already in .gitignore as .env.local)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Cron Jobs Not Running?
- ✅ Check secret is added in Vercel Dashboard
- ✅ Verify secret is set to "Production" environment only
- ✅ Wait for next scheduled execution time
- ✅ Check Vercel logs for error messages

### Manual Test Failing?
- Ensure you're using the production URL (`vibeshift.me`)
- Check the Authorization header matches exactly
- Verify the cron route is deployed (should be in latest deployment)

## Next Steps After Adding Secret

1. ✅ Add `CRON_SECRET` to Vercel (this guide)
2. ⏳ Wait for next scheduled cron execution
3. 📊 Monitor Vercel logs for successful runs
4. 🎉 Enjoy instant page loads for all users!
