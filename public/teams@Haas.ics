  reflect upon team objectives\, strategies\, and processes and to adapt th
 em accordingly. This is our primary goal for the Teams@Haas Team Check-i
 n Workshop. \n\nYour teams will have the opportunity to engage in this pr
 actice during the Teams@Haas Team Check-In facilitated by a Teams@Haas Exe

 your team with a new set of tools and to also support you in facilitating 
 a conversation for your team to step back and reflect on what is working w
 ell and where you might make adaptations for improved effectiveness.\n\nPr
