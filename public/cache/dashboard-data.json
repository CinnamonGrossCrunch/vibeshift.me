This is our primary goal for the Teams@Haas Team Check-in Workshop. \n\nYour teams will have the opportunity to engage in this practice during the Teams@Haas Team Check-In facilitated by a Teams@Haas Executive Coaching Team.  The goal of these workshops is to provide you and your team with a new set of tools and to also support you in facilitating a conversation for your team to step back and reflect on what is working well and where you might make adaptations for improved effectiveness.\n\nPrior to the Team Check-In Workshop, please:\n\n* Check Your Team's Workshop Time (no Berkeley time) & Location\n\n* Review your Team Collaborative Plan \n\n* Watch: [HIT Team Check-In Plenary Video] (https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1535656/pages/video-team-check-in)\n\nParticipation Grade: Attendance for this session is part of your Leading People participation grade.",

All of the cases are in the Study.Net reader. All are required reading and students should be prepared to discuss them in class.\n\nThis is your chance to decide as a team which case you want to focus on for the Case Preparation & Leadership Assignment. Two teams will be responsible for: (1) leading the class discussion of the key issues in the case, (2) writing a 3 page recap of their findings and recommendations, and (3) posting and monitoring a discussion board thread about the aspect of the case they are focusing on. One team will tackle the case from a company/competitive perspective and the other from a customer/consumer point of view.\n\nClick here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAx2ONcz6CF1ghWfKD8t6iBEygSTZaikBwqak3Iy22MedhSg/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=113674834595072819528) to see the questions to be addressed by the team responsible for our discussion of each case. Then, agree as a team on your top 3 choices and fill out this short preferences survey (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAx2ONcz6CF1ghWfKD8t6iBEygSTZaikBwqak3Iy22MedhSg/viewform?usp=header).

This person will be responsible for 1) preparing in advance by reviewing the process and objectives for each stage and pulling up the top three agreements from Check-In #1, 2) guiding the team through the entire workshop, 3) ensuring communication during the workshop is balanced (i.e., everyone has an opportunity to share and listen), 4) supporting the team in reaching 1-3 joint agreements in support of your team’s continued development and 5) uploading a photo of the Collaborative Map to bCourse by 10/24.  \n\nSupplies:\n\n* For an in-person check-in, teams will need a large whiteboard or easel pad, sticky notes, and markers. Kits with the needed supplies will be available in the MBA Lounge. Please return the kits to the lounge after using them so other teams can use them. \n\n* For a virtual check-in, teams can use the Zoom whiteboard function to create a collaborative map to support your brainstorming & discussion. \n\nResources:\n\n* [Check-In Video:] (https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1546457/pages/video-team-check-in) Refresher on the purpose of a Team Check-In.\n\n* [Self-Facilitated Check-In Deck:] (https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1546457/files/92053866?wrap=1) Provides detailed facilitation instructions\n\n* [Note:] (https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1546457/files/92053931?wrap=1) An Overview of Giving and Receiving Reflective Feedback in Teams\n\nSubmission\n\n* Photo of Collaborative Map with Team Agreements (1/team)",

Your recommendation (including the three points below) should be in the form of a memo to Ralph. It should be one page maximum (single-spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman, and 1-inch margins).\n\nAs a facilitator, you’ll use the preparation of this memo to help kick off and guide your group’s discussion. You won’t need to present your memo in full, but it should give you a clear point of view and framing to engage your teammates. Please remember: if you haven’t done the readings or submitted your memo, you won’t be equipped to lead your group and you’ll be letting your team down.\n\nRalph wants to see the following in your memo:\n\n1. A clear and succinct understanding of the key challenge(s) he faces in the situation, supported by case facts/observations.\n\n2. The pros/cons of various alternatives available and guidance on how the decision should be made.\n\n3. A strong rationale for your recommended action, based upon (1) and (2) above. \n\nTo support your thinking, you should also reflect on the following questions as you prepare:\n\n*\n\nHas Ralph made the transition from entrepreneurial to professional management?\n\n*\n\nWhat forces led to that transition?\n\n*\n\nWhat options does he have now?\n\n*\n\nHow does a leader know when it’s time to make this kind of shift?\n\n \n\nSubmission Details:\n\n*\n\nDue: On bCourses by 6:00 PM on the day of class\n\n*\n\nFormat: Type directly into the submission box\n\n*\n\nGrading: You will receive a grade out of 5 points based on the quality and effort demonstrated in your memo.

Conduct an interview with your team’s choice of a leader (any level, any type) and at least one person who reports to that leader, and to use as many other methods as you can, to learn about that person. Your final product will be a maximum of 1800 words (adhering to 1.5 spacing, 12-point Times New Roman font, and 1-inch margins). \n\n \n\nThe report should cover three key aspects: 1)What makes your chosen interviewee a leader, 2) an assessment of their strengths and weaknesses, and 3) constructive advice to help improve their situation. \n\n \n\nThe goal of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of course concepts by exploring leadership in practical settings. It also offers an opportunity to practice delivering honest and constructive feedback. Integrate relevant course concepts from lectures and readings, and feel free to supplement your analysis with high-quality external research. Creativity is encouraged in the style and presentation of your report, including the use of pictures and engaging headings. When selecting a leader to interview, be prepared to justify what makes this person a leader (i.e., Are they a leader through position and/or hierarchy? Are they a beloved and respected member of their community?).\n\n \n\nAs MBA students, I challenge you to rethink your perceptions of leadership. While you all possess leadership qualities worthy of being interviewed, you must all be willing to grow and change as leaders, especially as your rank, positions, or managerial responsibilities continue to evolve. One significant way to achieve this growth is by learning from and critically analyzing other leaders' experiences.\n\n \n\nPlease read the [full assignment details] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZloXH8r04sYvPSFiwXLmO8KW8nLCyWbfuOUU69kakQ/edit) and review the [rubric] (https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1545386/files/92116296?wrap=1).",
