Two teams will be responsible for: (1) leading the class discussion of the key issues in the case, (2) writing a 3 page recap of their findings and recommendations, and (3) posting and monitoring a discussion board thread about the aspect of the case they are focusing on. One team will tackle the case from a company/competitive perspective and the other from a customer/consumer point of view.\n\nClick here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAx2ONcz6CF1ghWfKD8t6iBEygSTZaikBwqak3Iy22MedhSg/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=113674834595072819528) to see the questions to be addressed by the team responsible for our discussion of each case.

        "description": "Case: Iggy's Bread of the World\n\nYou are a board member/trusted advisor making recommendations to the Ivanovics regarding both McRae's proposal and the problems unfolding that the Ivanovics need to deal with to continue to be successful. Your recommendation (including points 1-3 below) should be in the form of a memo to Iggy + Ludmilla.  It should be one page maximum (single-spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman, and 1-inch margins).\n\nAs a facilitator, you’ll use the preparation of this memo to help kick off and guide your group’s discussion. You won’t need to present your memo in full, but it should give you a clear point of view and framing to engage your teammates. Please remember: if you haven’t done the readings or submitted your memo, you won’t be equipped to lead your group and you’ll be letting your team down.\n\nIggy + Ludmilla want to see the following in your memo:\n\n1. A clear and succinct understanding of the key challenges they face in the situation. Your support of the challenges should include case facts/observations.\n\n2. The pros/cons of various alternatives available for addressing the challenges.\n\n3. A strong rationale for your recommended action, based upon (1) and (2) above. Not only should your recommendation be supported based upon the facts of the case and your expert knowledge (the “why”), but also your recommendation should include the “who, what, when, and how”.\n\nTo support your thinking, reflect on these questions:\n\n*\n\nWhat values have the Ivanovics instilled in Iggy’s culture, and how have they used direct, indirect, and symbolic influence to shape it?\n\n*\n\nWhat’s at stake in their current conflict with McRae? What’s driving the breakdown?\n\n*\n\nWhat’s your assessment of McRae’s role? Could the situation be repaired, or should they move on? If so, what’s next?\n\nSubmission Details:\n\n* Due: On bCourses by 6:00 PM on the day of class\n\n*\n\nFormat: Type directly into the submission box\n\n*\n\nGrading: You will receive a grade out of 5 points based on the quality and effort demonstrated in your memo. See rubric posted below.\n\nGood luck and have fun baking up a plan! 🥖",
