DESCRIPTION:We will be using several cases to illustrate key marketing conc
 epts this semester and deepen your understanding of the real-world busines
 s situations where marketers apply them. All of the cases are in the Study
 .Net reader. All are required reading and students should be prepared to d
 iscuss them in class.\n\nThis is your chance to decide as a team which cas
 e you want to focus on for the Case Preparation & Leadership Assignment. T
 wo teams will be responsible for: (1) leading the class discussion of the 
 key issues in the case\, (2) writing a 3 page recap of their findings and 
 recommendations\, and (3) posting and monitoring a discussion board thread
  about the aspect of the case they are focusing on. One team will tackle t
 he case from a company/competitive perspective and the other from a custom
 er/consumer point of view.\n\nClick here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d
 /e/1FAIpQLSfAx2ONcz6CF1ghWfKD8t6iBEygSTZaikBwqak3Iy22MedhSg/viewform?usp
 =sharing&ouid=113674834595072819528) to see the questions to be addressed 
 by the team responsible for our discussion of each case. Then\, agree as a
  team on your top 3 choices and fill out this short preferences survey (ht
 tps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAx2ONcz6CF1ghWfKD8t6iBEygSTZaikB
 wqak3Iy22MedhSg/viewform?usp=header). After submitting your response\, hav
 e one team member upload the confirmation page to bCourses.\n\nTeams will
