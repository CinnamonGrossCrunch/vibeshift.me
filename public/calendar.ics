 ts to that leader\, and to use as many other methods as you can\, to learn

 an opportunity to practice delivering honest and constructive feedback. In
 tegrate relevant course concepts from lectures and readings\, and feel fre
 e to supplement your analysis with high-quality external research. Creativ
 ity is encouraged in the style and presentation of your report\, including
  the use of pictures and engaging headings. When selecting a leader to int

 respected member of their community?).\n\n \n\nAs MBA students\, I challe
 nge you to rethink your perceptions of leadership. While you all possess l
 eadership qualities worthy of being interviewed\, you must all be willing 
 to grow and change as leaders\, especially as your rank\, positions\, or m

 Follow these instructions.] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V9NSjoUGF

 this class lies in the practical application of its lessons. This assignme
 nt is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-wo
 rld challenges in organizations. Working collaboratively within your Teams
 @Haas groups\, you will undertake a team research project focused on a man
 agerial-related topic within an organization of your choice. The primary o
 bjective of this project is to study the chosen organization and propose v
 iable improvements to its current situation.\n\nAfter researching the orga
 nization\, your team will identify a key people-focused challenge area for
  the organization (i.e. employee morale\, team design\, diversity\, equity
  and inclusion\, etc.)\, analyze the symptoms of this situation\, and delv
 e into the underlying causal factors influencing these symptoms.  Based o
 n the material covered in class\, your team will generate recommendations 
 for an intervention aimed at addressing the identified challenge. You are 
 encouraged to choose an organization where a member of the group plays a m
 anagement role or has a strong connection to someone with organizational d
 ecision-making power.\n\nYour team must submit a [proposal form] (https://
 bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1545386/assignments/8916938) by 8/22 at 10pm
 . Additionally\, I encourage you to reach out via email or schedule office
  hours to discuss your chosen organization in advance. This will allow for
  valuable feedback and guidance to ensure your project's success.\n\nThe f
 inal deliverable will be an engaging and persuasive pre-recorded presentat
 ion\, lasting 10 to 14 minutes. Your presentation should be accompanied by
  a well-structured slide deck and recorded using Zoom (or an alternative t
 echnology). Adopt a consultant-style approach where you present the findin
 gs and recommendations while supporting the client to wrestle with the pro
 s and cons of making a commitment to take action. \n\nTo ensure the effec
 tiveness of your presentation\, present your identified problem with clari
 ty and precision. Articulate your message and recommendations in a compell
 ing and concise manner\, inspiring confidence in your proposed solutions. 
 Back up your analysis of the problem with relevant evidence from the organ
 izational environment\, demonstrating the depth of your research and under
 standing. Moreover\, elaborate on what you see are the first critical step
 s for the client to take to put your ideas into action. Your presentation 
 should be professional\, engaging\, and informative.\n\nPart 2: Presentati
